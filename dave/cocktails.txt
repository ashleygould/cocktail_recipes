French 75 variations

French 75

  1.0 oz gin (left) or 1.0 oz Cognac right)
  0.5 oz simple syrup
  0.5 oz lemon juice
  2.5 oz sparkling wine or champagne • ⁠lemon twist, to garnish

Morgenthaler has an interesting take. The French 75 is a Tom Collins (8% abv)
with champagne instead of club soda (15.5% abv). So serve it on the rocks
in a Collins glass.

And if you have limoncello, try the French 105; replace the lemon and simple
with 1 oz limoncello and 0.5 tsp lemon juice: an even bigger kick (20.5% abv).
