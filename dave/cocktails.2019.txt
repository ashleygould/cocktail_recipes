French 75 variations

French 75

    ⁠1 ounce gin (left) or 1oz Cognac right)
    ⁠1/2 ounce simple syrup
    ⁠1/2 ounce lemon juice
    ⁠3 ounces champagne • ⁠lemon twist, to garnish

Morgenthaler has an interesting take. The French 75 is a Tom Collins (8% abv)
with champagne instead of club soda (15.5% abv). So serve it on the rocks
in a Collins glass.

And if you have limoncello, try the French 105; replace the lemon and simple
with 1 oz limoncello and 1/2 tsp lemon juice: an even bigger kick (20.5% abv).
